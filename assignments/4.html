        </header>

        <section>
            <p><strong>Due September 25 at 6pm</strong></p>
            <p>We talked more about data and JavaScript this week, and we'll exercise some of our new knowledge around it while building upon HTML and CSS.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Work on some code</h2>
            <p>We've covered a lot of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over the past four weeks. Use this assignment to work on something of your choosing&mdash;HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a mix of each. Whatever you work on should include a map. Post the code to Glitch and submit a link to it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Final project proposal</h2>
            <p>Flesh out your thoughts for one of your project ideas from last time. See the <a href="final.html">final project assignment</a> for a refresher on what is required. Write about:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The project idea: what is it? why do you want to explore it?</li>
                <li>Data sources you will likely use.</li>
                <li>What features your project will include.</li>
                <li>What you want the project to look like. While not required, a rough sketch of what you want the site to look like is strongly recommended.</li>
                <li>Your timeline for the project. Remember that it is due the last night of class, October 16. Be ambitious but realistic&mdash;what are the phases of the project? What is the bare minimum you could accomplish for the class and while being happy with it? Which parts would you consider continuing to work on after class?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Submit a (1/2- to 1-page) <strong>PDF or Word document</strong> in the upload field set aside for it on the assignment submission form. We will briefly and informally talk about these at the beginning of class on the evening this assignment is due, so please be prepared for that.</p>
        </section>
