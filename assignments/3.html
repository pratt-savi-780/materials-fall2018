        </header>

        <section>
            <p><strong>Due September 18 at 6pm</strong></p>
            <p>We talked more about JavaScript this week, and we'll exercise some of our new knowledge around it while building upon HTML and CSS.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>The JavaScript resources suggest last week still apply:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Khan Academy <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JavaScript online course</a> is popular</li>
                    <li>Codecademy's <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Introduction to JavaScript is also worthwhile</a></li>
                    <li>NodeSchool has a series of exercises written in Glitch projects called <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/javascripting">JavaScripting</a></li>
                    <li>If you're looking for a resource on JavaScript that you can read through, the first few chapters of <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> is a good source. It goes a little more in depth than you need to right now, so feel free to skip and skim parts of it.</li>
                    <li>Another readable resource is <a href="http://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/javascript/">Learn JavaScript</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://jsforcats.com/">JavaScript for Cats</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Focus on the core concepts of JavaScript: variables, arrays, objects, and functions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Create a map using more advanced JavaScript and Leaflet features</h2>
            <p>This week we covered advanced JavaScript and Leaflet features such as popups, feature styling, filtering, and events. This assignment is an opportunity to apply each of these to either your map from last time or a new one.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Decide whether you are creating a new map for this assignment or extending your map from the last assignment. Either way, create a new Glitch app for this assignment&mdash;you can remix your app from the last assignment.</li>
                <li>Add popups to the map that provide more information about the features.</li>
                <li>Style the popups with CSS.</li>
                <li>Style the features.</li>
                <li>Use event listeners to respond to an event of your choosing and change the map in some way. For example, this could be a link or button on your page that filters the data on the map when it is clicked. It could also be some HTML form input that filters the data in a more complex way, or an event that is more specific to Leaflet such as a click on a feature.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Final project thoughts</h2>
            <p>What are you thinking about doing for your final project? You can read more about what is required at <a href="final.html">the assignment for it</a>. Next week you will submit a projet proposal, but for now please submit a paragraph or two covering:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>One or two topics you might like to do your project on.</li>
                <li>Potential data sources for your project.</li>
                <li>Other web maps you find inspiring or that are similar to what you're considering making.</li>
                <li>Which skills you'd like to get more practice with through this project.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Submit the paragraph in the text field set aside for it on the assignment submission form.</p>
        </section>
